A set of libraries to help users find and replace native system emojis with JoyPixels (formerly EmojiOne) in their app or website.

> Heads up! 
> EmojiOne has rebranded to JoyPixels. Please see our [UPGRADE DOC](UPGRADE.md) for details on what's new, especially 
> if you're migrating from [emojione](https://www.github.com/joypixels/emojione), as all references to "emojione" in
> class names and file names have been changed.

## What's Included?

 - This project includes libraries used to convert emoji into various formats, including conversion to JoyPixels emoji images.
